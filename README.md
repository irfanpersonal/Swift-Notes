# Swift Notes

Welcome to Swift Notes! It might not be the grandest project out there, but it's my stepping stone into the exciting world of more intricate developments. In this journey, I've chosen MySQL as the database and Sequelize as the ORM, making project interaction and setup a breeze. One thing you'll notice is the heavy documentation in the code. I wanted this to be more than just a functional project. I envisioned it as a reference guide for my future endeavors. The documentation not only guides current use but serves as a compass for navigating through the complexities of upcoming projects. You might observe a familiar flow if you've worked with MERN applications. I intentionally maintained a similar structure, making it easy for anyone diving in to quickly catch on. While some things have evolved, the core structure remains, providing a sense of familiarity for those experienced with MERN. To enhance functionality and troubleshoot potential issues, I've incorporated a ton of third-party modules like redux toolkit, axios, cookie-parser, http-status-codes, react-toastify, react-icons, jsonwebtoken, validator, and much much more. This ensures a robust setup where every possible hiccup is anticipated and addressed. So, kick back, explore Swift Notes, and I hope you find it not just functional but enjoyable. Take care and happy coding!

## Technologies Used

- [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/): A powerful and flexible Node.js ORM for SQL databases.
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/): Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/): An open-source relational database management system.

## Setup Instructions

1st - Download the project

2nd - Run the following command "npm install" (install dependencies)

3rd - Create a .env file in root with the following key value pairs: MYSQL_DATABASE_PASSWORD, JWT_SECRET, and JWT_LIFETIME. 

4th - Open up your MySQL server and create a database called SWIFT_NOTES. So just copy paste this code in an execute it  CREATE DATABASE SWIFT_NOTES;

5th - Type the following command "npm run start" to start application
